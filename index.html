    <p class="card-text"> I would like to be Deputy head boy so I can make a change.I would like to make bonding and learning more fun for all.
                Being Deputy Head Boy is not about being better than anyone else, it's about doing the best I can for everyone including listening to your ideas (not just my own) and carrying them out to the best of my ability, representing the
                Beaconhouse College and upholding the 'outstanding' reputation.  Lots of decisions are made by teachers in this collage but this is your chance to pick me to represent your voice if you don't want to say it yourself.
                Please vote for me, as you definitely will not regret it if I become Deputy head boy because I will always respect and value you as individuals, and always be 100% dedicated to my role.</p>
